# Game of Life<sup>n</sup>

## About
This is a framework for expressing Conway's Game of Life in an n-cube of arbitrary size.  Game of Life<sup>n</sup> started as an exercise in functional programming using ES2015 inspired by Reginald Braithwaite's _JavaScript Allong√©_.  The exercise was more engaging than I expected, and it led to some interesting questions about how to best express certain data structures in JavaScript.

## New Game
The Game of Life<sup>n</sup> module exports a generator function.  The function accepts two optional arguments.  The first argument is an object indicating the size and dimensions of the game field.  The second argument is a comma-separated list of points that represent which cells are "alive" at the start of the game.

```js
const gameFactory = require('game-of-life-n');
let game = gameFactory({
  size: 4, // length of each side of the square, cube or hypercube
  dimensions: 2 // number of spatial dimensions; 2 = square, 3 = cube, 4+ = hypercube
}, 0, 1, 2, 3);
```

## Game State
JavaScript does not support true multidimensional arrays, so Game of Life<sup>n</sup> uses a single arrayto represent the game state.  This array is one-dimensional and contains `0`s and `1`s.  `1` represents a live cell, and `0` represents a dead cell.

## Grid Conventions
A single array can effectively represent multidimensional space in Game of Life<sup>n</sup> by using arithmetic to look up coordinates.  In a game of 3 dimensions with length 3, the point at coordinates (0, 0, 0) is stored at Array[0].  Point (0, 0, 1) is stored at Array[18].  See `./lib/grid.js` for a more detailed look at the arithmetic that powers the grid system.
